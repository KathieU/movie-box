# Movie Discovery Web Application

This is a React-based web application that allows users to search for movies, view movie details, and save their favorite movies. It fetches data from the TMDB API.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Node.js: Make sure you have Node.js installed on your computer. You can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/movie-discovery-app.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   
  ```bash
  ```cd movie-discovery-app```

3. Install the project dependencies using npm or yarn:
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    ```bash
    yarn install

Configuration
To configure the TMDB API integration, you'll need to obtain an API key from the TMDB website and replace the API key in the code. You can find the API key configuration in the relevant components (e.g., MovieSearch.js and fetchMovieDetailsById.js).

Usage
Start the development server:

bash
Copy code
npm start
# or
yarn start
This will start the development server and open the application in your default web browser.

Use the application:

Open the application in your web browser and start searching for movies by title.
Click on a movie card to view its details, including the movie poster, title, release date, and more.
Save your favorite movies or implement additional features as needed.
